# RestoreWP Background Processing Implementation

## Problem Solved
- **Frontend Blocking**: Export/import operations were blocking the frontend, making the site unresponsive during large operations
- **No Cancellation**: Users couldn't cancel long-running operations
- **Poor UX**: No real-time progress updates or user control

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Background Process Handler (`class-restorewp-background-process.php`)
- **Non-blocking execution**: Uses WordPress cron to run processes in background
- **Process tracking**: Each operation gets a unique process ID for monitoring
- **Cancellation support**: Users can cancel operations with proper cleanup
- **Status management**: Real-time status updates with progress tracking

### 2. Updated Export Class (`class-restorewp-export.php`)
- **Process ID integration**: Supports background processing mode
- **Cancellation checks**: Periodically checks if process was cancelled
- **Progress tracking**: Detailed progress updates (10% database, 40% files, etc.)
- **Graceful interruption**: Safely stops when cancelled

### 3. Updated Import Class (`class-restorewp-import.php`)
- **Background support**: Same process ID integration as export
- **Cancellation safety**: Checks for cancellation during database operations
- **Progress granularity**: Shows progress for each import phase
- **Cleanup on cancel**: Removes temporary files when cancelled

### 4. Enhanced Admin Interface (`class-restorewp-admin.php`)
- **New AJAX endpoints**: 
  - `restorewp_status` - Get process status
  - `restorewp_cancel` - Cancel running process
- **Background process integration**: Starts processes via background handler
- **Process monitoring**: Returns process ID for client-side tracking

### 5. Improved JavaScript (`admin.js`)
- **Status polling**: Continuously checks process status every second
- **Cancel functionality**: Shows cancel button with confirmation dialog
- **Real-time updates**: Updates progress bar and status messages
- **Process isolation**: Tracks current process ID to prevent conflicts

### 6. Enhanced CSS (`admin.css`)
- **Cancel button styling**: Red warning-style button for cancellation
- **Background notices**: Green info boxes explaining background processing
- **Status indicators**: Different colors for various process states
- **Warning dialogs**: Styled confirmation dialogs for cancellation

## Key Features Added

### ✅ Non-Blocking Operations
- Export/import runs in background using WordPress cron
- Frontend remains fully functional during operations
- No server timeouts or memory issues

### ✅ Cancellation with Warning
- Cancel button appears during operations
- Confirmation dialog warns about consequences
- Proper cleanup of temporary files and processes

### ✅ Real-Time Progress
- Live progress updates every second
- Detailed status messages for each phase
- Progress percentage with visual indicators

### ✅ Process Safety
- Unique process IDs prevent conflicts
- Graceful handling of cancelled operations
- Automatic cleanup of failed processes

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Site becomes unresponsive during export/import
- No way to cancel long operations
- Users had to wait or force-refresh browser
- Large sites could cause timeouts

### After
- Site remains fully functional
- Clear progress indication with cancel option
- Background processing notices inform users
- Can handle sites of any size without blocking

## Technical Implementation

### Process Flow
1. User clicks Export/Import
2. AJAX call creates background process
3. WordPress cron executes actual operation
4. JavaScript polls for status updates
5. Real-time progress shown to user
6. User can cancel with confirmation
7. Process completes or is cancelled safely

### Cancellation Safety
- Checks for cancellation every 50 database queries
- Validates process status before major operations
- Cleans up temporary files on cancellation
- Updates UI immediately when cancelled

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if background processing fails
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Automatic cleanup of failed processes
- Fallback to synchronous mode if needed
